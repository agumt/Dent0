# Dent0
Observing some of the basic public and private services our country has to offer we have come up with a management system for Dental clinics. Although unfortunately a majority of people do not pay attention to their health until it becomes too late, we have tried to make the process of finding a dentist and making an appointment with them much more interacting and doable with a few clicks of a button.  
We heard a saying not too long ago saying “Smile while you still have teeth”, with our management system we aim to make it much easier for people to have easy access to Dentary Medical Assistance and extend that “while” for as a long as we can. 
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based dental management system that makes it easy for patients to find new dentists and schedule appointments with them. The system will allow patients to search for dentists based on location, availability, and other criteria, and will provide detailed information about each dentist, including their qualifications, ratings, and reviews.
The information people have about registered dentists is too limited and usually it is done by referral to one another or from word-of-mouth.
